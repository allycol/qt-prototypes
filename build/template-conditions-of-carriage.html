    <h3>2. When These Conditions Of Carriage Apply</h3>

    <h4>2.1 Application of Conditions of Carriage</h4>

    <p>Except as provided in 2.4 (Overriding Law), 2.5 (Reading Down) and 2.8 (Charter Operations), these Conditions of Carriage apply to travel on our flights or flight segments, where 'Qantas' or our Airline Designator Code 'QF' is shown as the Carrier on your Ticket, and in any case where we have a legal liability to you in relation to your flight.</p>

    <h4>2.2 Gratuitous or Reduced Fare Carriage</h4>

    <p>These Conditions of Carriage apply to Qantas Frequent Flyer Award travel and to gratuitous and reduced fare carriage, except to the extent that we have told you otherwise.</p>

    <h4>2.3 Basis of Carriage</h4>

    <p>The carriage of a Passenger on any flight by Qantas under the QF Airline Designator Code is, without exception, subject to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>these Conditions of Carriage</li>
        <li>any applicable Tariffs filed by us with regulatory bodies</li>
        <li>the Convention and any other applicable laws</li>
        <li>any specific directions given to a Passenger in writing or orally by our staff, and</li>
        <li>the fare rules or Qantas Frequent Flyer Award redemption rules, as applicable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2.4 Overriding Law</h4>

    <p>These Conditions of Carriage do not apply to the extent that they are inconsistent with laws that apply to your carriage.</p>
    <p>In respect of any goods or services we may provide other than carriage, certain statutory guarantees or warranties may apply for the benefit of consumers. For example, for consumers, services may come with a non-excludable guarantee or warranty that they will be provided with due care and skill. The nature and application of these guarantees or warranties will depend on the relevant jurisdiction. Nothing in these Conditions of Carriage is intended to exclude or restrict the application of such consumer laws.</p>
    <p>In respect of goods or services acquired for business purposes and not as a consumer:</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>consumer guarantees and warranties, including under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth), a Fair Trading Act or the New Zealand Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 (NZ), will not apply where these Conditions of Carriage apply, provided that the relevant terms may by law be excluded; and</li>
        <li>if a statute or other law provides a guarantee or warranty that cannot be excluded, to the extent permitted by law our liability for a breach of the guarantee or warranty will be limited to either supplying the goods or services again or paying the cost of having them supplied again, as determined by us.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>2.5 Reading Down</h4>

    <p>If any of these Conditions of Carriage is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, it will be read down to the extent necessary to ensure that it is not invalid, illegal or unenforceable, but if that is not possible, it will be severed from the Conditions of Carriage and the other conditions will remain valid.</p>

    <h4>2.6 Cannot Vary</h4>

    <p>No Qantas employee or other person is authorised to vary any of these Conditions of Carriage. However, this does not affect our right to waive any fare rule or amount payable. A waiver on one occasion does not constitute a waiver on any other occasion.</p>

    <h4>2.7 Conditions Prevail Over Special Procedures</h4>

    <p>We may publish a summary of these Conditions of Carriage to assist in drawing key issues to the attention of Passengers. The terms of these Conditions of Carriage will prevail over any summary of them.</p>
    <p>Subject to 2.4 (Overriding Law), if any of these Conditions of Carriage is inconsistent with any special procedures we may have (for example, in relation to the carriage of unaccompanied minors or Passengers with limited mobility), these Conditions of Carriage will prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.</p>

    <h4>2.8 Charter Operations</h4>

    <p>If carriage is performed by us under a charter agreement (hire arrangement), these Conditions of Carriage apply unless Passengers are advised otherwise by or on behalf of the charterer prior to boarding the aircraft.</p>

    <h4>2.9 Additional Services or Other Forms of Transportation</h4>

    <ol type="a">
        <li>If we make arrangements for you with any third party to provide any services other than carriage by air on a QF Airline Designator Code, or if we issue a Ticket or voucher relating to transportation or services (other than carriage by air) provided by a third party, such as hotel reservations or car rental, in doing so we act only as agent. The terms and conditions of the third party service provider will apply.</li>
        <li>If we are also providing non-airline transportation to you, our Conditions of Carriage do not apply to such transportation. The operator's conditions of carriage may significantly limit or exclude liability. Details are available upon request.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>3. General</h3>

    <h4>3.1 Preparing to Travel</h4>

    <p>Travel advisory services are not included in the price of your Ticket. You alone are responsible for making all necessary arrangements for your travel and ensuring that you comply with all laws, regulations and orders of the places you will travel to, such as:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>finding out from relevant embassies or consulates whether you need a passport, visa or other travel document, health document or evidence of onward travel</li>
        <li>obtaining those documents</li>
        <li>obtaining inoculations, and</li>
        <li>finding out about dangers to your health and safety at your destination and any Stopover (see 3.2).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If we provide assistance for any of the above aspects of your travel, this does not release you from your responsibility in respect of these matters.</p>

    <h4>3.2 Destination - Passenger Enquiries</h4>

        <p>It is your responsibility to enquire about any local issues and conditions at your destination(s) prior to commencing travel. We make no representations as to the safety, conditions or other issues that may exist at any destination. Travel advice can be obtained from various sources, including local governments, local consular offices and the website of the <a href="#">Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade</a>, the <a href="#">New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade</a>, or the <a href="#">U.S. Bureau of Consular Affairs</a>.</p>

    <h4>3.3 Travel Insurance</h4>

    <p>Because travel involves many risks, and our liability to you is limited, you may choose to purchase travel insurance, which can cover things like:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>lost Tickets</li>
        <li>changes in travel plans and travel cancellation</li>
        <li>medical and hospital expenses</li>
        <li>repatriation costs</li>
        <li>personal injury and death</li>
        <li>delayed, damaged or lost Baggage and other items</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3.4 Codeshares</h4>

    <p>We have arrangements with other Carriers known as 'Codeshares'. This means that even if you have made a reservation with us and hold a Ticket for a Qantas flight (ie, a flight with a QF Airline Designator Code), you may travel on another Carrier's aircraft.</p>

    <p>If such arrangements apply to your flight, we will advise you of the Carrier operating the aircraft at the time you make a reservation. The conditions of carriage of the Carrier whose flight number appears on your Ticket will apply to your Codeshare flight.</p>

    <p>Unless we advise you otherwise, where a QF Codeshare flight departs from an airport in the United States, the tarmac delay contingency plan of the operating Carrier will apply to your flight.</p>

    <h4>3.5 Health</h4>

    <ol type="a">
        <li>General
            <p>We may refuse to carry you if we, acting reasonably, are not completely satisfied that it is safe for you to fly. Before you make a reservation you should tell us if you suffer from any illness, disease or other condition which may make it unsafe for you or other Passengers if you fly.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
            <p>Some studies have concluded that prolonged immobility may be a risk factor in the formation of clots in the legs, known as DVT. If you feel you may be at risk from DVT or other health problems, consult with your doctor before travel. Information on health issues can be found:</p>

                <li>online at <a href="#">Your Health Inflight</a></li>
                <li>in the 'Onboard Information' pages of our inflight magazine - Qantas The Australian Way</li>
                <li>onboard our aircraft through our entertainment system</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Pregnancy
            <p>If you are pregnant, the following precautions must be observed.</p>
            <p><strong>For travel after the first 28 weeks of your pregnancy:</strong> you need to carry a certificate or letter from a registered medical practitioner or registered midwife confirming:</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the estimated date of delivery</li>
                    <li>whether it is a single or multiple pregnancy; and</li>
                    <li>that there are no complications with your pregnancy</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>For flights of four hours or more:</strong></p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>if you are having no complications with your pregnancy you can travel up to the end of the 36th week of your pregnancy for single pregnancies or up to the end of the 32nd week for multiple pregnancies (for example, twins)</li>
                    <li>medical clearance is required if you are having complications with your pregnancy</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>For flights of less than four hours:</strong></p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>if you are having no complications with your pregnancy you can travel up to the end of the 40th week of your pregnancy for single pregnancies and up to the end of the 36th week for multiple pregnancies (for example, twins)</li>
                    <li>Medical clearance is required if you are having complications with your pregnancy</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>If you wish to travel within seven days after delivery, medical clearance is required. Infants cannot travel for 48 hours after delivery and need medical clearance to travel between three and seven days after delivery.</p>
            <p><strong>Please Note:</strong></p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We do not represent that travel is safe for you at any particular point during your pregnancy. You must seek advice from your own medical practitioner prior to your flight. The periods referred to above are only our minimum requirements</li>
                    <li>Some countries place limitations on the entry of non-national pregnant women. Check with the relevant embassy or consulate before you travel to confirm any further limitations.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </li>
